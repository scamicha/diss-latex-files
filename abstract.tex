The question of how gas giant planets form has been an area of active research for over a decade. Over the past several years, research of gas giant planet formation has yielded two major theories, core accretion and gravitational instability. Although some studies have indicated that gravitational instabilities cannot form gas giant planets directly, it is clear that they can have a significant effect on a protoplanetary disk. In this thesis I several possible effects that gravitational instabilities may have on a protoplanetary disk. This study is carried out using three dimensional numerical simulations of protoplanetary disks. Over twenty simulations with varying initial conditions, resolutions, and physical effects have been carried out and analyzed. Although all indications from these simulations are that gravitational instabilities cannot form gas giant planets directly at radii smaller than 40AU, I have learned that gravitational instabilities can have a dramatic effect on protoplanetary disk structure and planets embedded in a protoplanetary disk.
